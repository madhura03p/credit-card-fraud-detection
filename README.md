# credit-card-fraud-detection
Using R to detect credit card fraud 
In this, there were two samples made using two different methods: over sampling, and over and under sampling. This was done because the dataset conatined only 0.14% fraud cases.
When random forest is used to train an over sampled and under sampled data, we get 99.52% accuracy. When the same algorithm is used to train an oversampled data we get 99.75% accuracy.
When a decision tree was implements, it gave 99.97% accuracy.
